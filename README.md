- 👋 Hi, I’m @ozymeric
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html-css-javascript, git, github and bash terminal commands. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basic, simple, beginner friendly projects for practical purposes in order to gain experience and confidence on this branch.
- 📫 How to reach me: can send an e-mail without hesitation.(mail.ozanmeric@gmail.com)

I've been studying on several programing languages such as Python, JavaScript and Solidity for around a year by now. Started to this journey as a complete beginner just because I found it exciting; but the more I merged with different programing languages, the more I started to feel mesmerized by the depth of this branch. And now I want to take one more step ahead and want to collaborate with people who find programing as excited... ✌😉
